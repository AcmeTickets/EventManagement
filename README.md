# Event Management Domain Solution

This solution provides a robust, cloud-ready template for managing events and their lifecycle using modern .NET and Azure technologies. It is designed for extensibility, scalability, and best practices in distributed systems.

## High-Level Capabilities

- **Event Lifecycle Management**: Create, update, expire, and close events, tracking their full lifecycle.
- **API Service**: Exposes RESTful endpoints for event operations, validation, and integration with external systems.
- **Message Processor**: Handles background processing and event-driven workflows using NServiceBus.
- **Distributed Messaging**: Utilizes Azure Service Bus and NServiceBus for reliable, decoupled communication between services.
- **Cosmos DB Integration**: Stores event data in a globally distributed, highly available NoSQL database.
- **Health Checks**: Provides health endpoints for container orchestration and monitoring.
- **Cloud-Native Deployment**: Ready for Azure Container Apps and Docker-based deployments.
- **CI/CD Ready**: Includes GitHub Actions workflows for automated build, test, and deployment.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add new commands, events, and handlers to support evolving business needs.

## Solution Structure

- **API**: Handles HTTP requests, event creation, and publishes domain events.
- **Message**: Processes events and commands asynchronously, supporting event-driven business logic.
